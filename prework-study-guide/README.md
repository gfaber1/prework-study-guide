# Prework study guide webpage

## Description
Wanted to create a simple organized webpage for new bootcamp students. I built this because it is a good way to practice and learn the basic tools i will need throughout the Coding bootcamp. This webpage solves the problemv of students spending extra time looking for information. I learned a lot of basic things about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I also learned how to think like a developer.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In this webpage there are four sections that have usefull notes for their respective topics. HTML, CSS JavaScript and Git are all covered. The devTools consol is also showing the JavaScript running, it lists the topics that are covered and suggests a topic to start on.
